## "Hacking: The Art of Exploitation" Experimental Web Code

This repo contains code from "Hacking: The Art of Exploitation" by Jon Ericson.

Also has code from tutorial by "Silver Moon" https://www.binarytides.com/socket-programming-c-linux-tutorial/

This repo is mostly for easily moving code to my cloud server, when I have internet access.

Notes:

- GCP has a firewall blocking a lot of stuff by default
